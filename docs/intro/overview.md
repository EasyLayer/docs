Welcome to the official documentation of our blockchain interaction project, a suite of **self-hosted** applications developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Our tools is designed for developers who seek an efficient and streamlined way to connect with various blockchain networks.

Our tools offer a robust API that simplifies the complexities of **blockchain processing**. We've encapsulated the intricate logic of connecting to blockchain nodes, managing wallets, creating and sending transactions, monitoring transaction statuses, and more. We streamlines blockchain data indexing, making it easier to manage and query vast amounts of blockchain data. We also simplify event handling, enabling seamless subscription to and retrieval of blockchain events. This abstraction not only enhances usability but also accelerates development processes.

Developers can effortlessly set up their applications in just a few simple steps. To facilitate this, we have developed a custom **protocol** that allows full customization of the specific blockchain data you want to manage. Once deployed, they can leverage the API to access a wide range of features and capabilities, giving them complete control over how they interact with and process blockchain data.

To stay up to date with our latest plans, upcoming features, and updates, you can follow our **roadmap**. We are committed to transparency and sharing our development progress with the community. Visit our [website](https://easylayer.io) to view the roadmap and track the features and improvements we're actively working on. Stay tuned for continuous enhancements and new capabilities as we evolve our platform!

Our core tools utilize the [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com), emphasizing modern, robust, and scalable software architecture. We adhere to principles like **Event Sourcing**, **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**, and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, ensuring that our solutions are not only powerful but also maintainable and extensible.

## Philosophy

Our philosophy revolves around three core principles: simplicity, flexibility, and power.

1. **Simplicity**: We believe that interacting with blockchain technology should be straightforward and accessible. By abstracting complex underlying mechanisms, we provide a user-friendly interface that allows developers to focus on creating value rather than grappling with technical intricacies.

2. **Flexibility**: Our platform is built with customization in mind. The protocol system exemplifies this, as it enables users to tailor the application to their specific needs.

3. **Power**: Despite the simplicity of our interface, we do not compromise on the capabilities of our applications. Our solutions are designed to handle the demands of modern blockchain applications, ensuring that developers have access to a robust and capable toolset.

By marrying these principles with our commitment to cutting-edge technology and best practices in software architecture, we aim to empower developers to build the next generation of blockchain applications with ease and confidence.
