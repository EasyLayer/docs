### Overview

**Wallet** is a self-hosted application that provides an out-of-the-box solution for managing multiple cryptocurrency keys and transactions. It supports key generation, signing and broadcasting transactions, fee calculation, and more. 

Wallet offers a **ready-made RPC API**, making it easy for developers to integrate it into their systems. It also supports environment variables (envs) for flexible configuration, ensuring that each instance can be tailored to the developer's infrastructure.
